# Observer RSS

A dumb script to generate a RSS feed for [The
Observer](https://www.ndsmcobserver.com/), since apparently they don't provide
that themselves (anymore).

It works by scraping the different sections of the website.

You can find the generated feed here:
[yld.me/raw/observer-rss](https://yld.me/raw/observer-rss).

It is updated **every hour**.

Based off [firefox-rss](https://github.com/pbui/firefox-rss).
